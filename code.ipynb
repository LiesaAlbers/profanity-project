    "## 1. Introduction & Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to study the contextual application of profanity across different music genres. By comparing different popular genres including rap and pop, we aim to provide a nuanced perspective on language in popular music, potentially challenging (or reaffirming) stereotypes regarding the use of explicit language within rap. Common preconceptions suggest that rap music is characterised as aggressive, offensive, misogynistic or even violent in its use of profanity (Howard et al., 2021). A study found that rap accounted for 76% of profanity within top 10 songs in the Billboard Hot 100 from 2009-2018 (Moloney and Sylva, 2020). Another study found that rap ranked number one for the most profanity used, with a swear word in every 47 words, and pop ranked number four, with a swear word every 904 words (Medium, 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, profanity can serve various purposes, from expressing intense emotions (both positive and negative) to emphasising statements or simply being used as a device to create linguistic rhythm. For instance, while the term 'bitch' is frequently employed as a word used to dehumanise and to insult women, it can also be utilised as a symbol of empowerment or an expression of camaraderie. This research aims to provide a nuanced perspective on the complex role of profanity in popular music, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of linguistic choices in contemporary musical expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop music is often produced for mass consumption, so characteristics of pop music tend to include catchy, simple melodies, repetitive beats and straightforward lyrics (Musical Dictionary, 2024). As a result, it’s often the most accessible music and most recognisable genre of music, but due to its broad target audience, pop music typically avoids the use of profanity or incorporates it sparingly. Conversely, rap music, while also a form of popular music, emerged in the 1970s through the creativity of urban Black performers. It is commonly identified by its repetitive beat patterns and rapid, slang-heavy, and often boastful rhyming vocal delivery (Dictionary.com, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, rap music has achieved significant prominence in mainstream media, propelled by artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, and Drake, and now accounts for a substantial share of contemporary music airplay (Bruner, 2018). The goal of this project is to conduct research that explores usage of profanity in rap and pop music lyrics, addressing the question: \n",
    "- *How does the sentiment and usage of profanity differ between rap and pop music lyrics, and does this support or challenge stereotypes about profanity in rap music?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insight into the music commonly consumed by the general public within the rap and pop genres, this study utilises Apple Music's playlists, *Top 100 2024: Shazam’s Radio Chart*. This resource includes curated playlists for several genres, including hip-hop and pop, comprising songs that are currently popular on radio stations worldwide. As such, it serves as a representative sample of the music that is being listened to by the general public. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although a rap playlist was not available, we determined that the hip-hop playlist would be a suitable alternative, given the close relationship between the two terms and their frequent interchangeable use. While all rap falls under the umbrella of hip-hop, not all hip-hop is rap, as hip-hop also encompasses instrumental tracks and other vocal styles. In mainstream media, however, the term \"hip-hop\" is often used synonymously with rap. It is important to emphasise that hip-hop represents a broader cultural movement, whereas rap is the musical art form that serves as a central component of this culture (Medium, 2022)."

    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of collecting, managing, exploring, analysing, and visualising this study's data using Python. Our focus will be on analysing song lyrics to extract and annotate profanity, while also providing context for each instance. We will use various Python libraries, including `pandas`, `selenium`, `BeautifulSoup` and `langdetect`, to achieve our goal."

    "#### Web Scraping Lists of Song Titles and Artists for Each Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will collect data from the *Top 100 2024: Shazam Radio Charts* for both Hip-Hop and Pop genres:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hip-Hop: https://music.apple.com/be/playlist/top-100-2024-shazam-radio-chart-hip-hop/pl.745180bfbd374d56aa07d84c9420e5dc\n",

    "\n",
    "The information we're interested in are the song titles and artists so that we can use that information to web scrape the lyrics of those specific songs from [AZlyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/) later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this we will be using the Selenium package. The data we want to scrape is dynamically loaded, meaning that it is not present in the initial HTML response that you receive when you make a request to a webpage (with BeautifulSoup). Instead, the content is generated and inserted into the page after the initial load, typically through JavaScript. For example, a webpage might initially load a blank list and then use JavaScript to fetch and display song titles and artists from a server after the page has loaded. If you view the page source in this case, you may not see the song titles and artists because they are added to the DOM after the page has loaded. Selenium is a web automation tool that can control a web browser programmatically. It can wait for JavaScript to execute and for elements to be rendered on the page, allowing you to scrape content that is dynamically loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that the code in this notebook was specifically written to extract the data from Apple musics' Top 100 2024: Shazam Radio Lists at the time of conducting this study (january 2025). Apple music may decide to change the songs listed in their playlists at some point in time which will have a minor effect on the efficiency of some of the code below.*"
