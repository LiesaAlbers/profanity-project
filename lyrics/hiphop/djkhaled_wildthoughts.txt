 [Rihanna:] 
I don't know if you could take it 
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked 
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby 
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag 
White girl wasted on that brown liquor 
When I get like this I can't be around you 
I'm too lit to dim down a notch 
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do 
 
Wild, wild, wild 
Wild, wild, wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
 
 [DJ Khaled:] 
Let's go! 
 
 [Rihanna:] 
I hope you know I'm for the takin' 
You know this cookie is for the baking 
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest 
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets 
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya 
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya 
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sister 
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya 
 
I know I get 
Wild, wild, wild 
Wild, wild, wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
 
 [Bryson Tiller:] 
Ayy, ugh, ugh, I heard that pussy for the taking 
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy 
Yeah, I treat you like a lady, lady 
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation (burned out) 
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang 
Throw that ass back, bouquet, bouquet 
Call me and I can get it juicy 
I can tell you're gone off the D'ussÃ© 
Careful, mama, watch what you say 
You talking to me like ya new bae 
Girl, you talking like you tryna do things 
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby 
You made me drown in it, ooh, touche, baby 
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby 
And you know I'mma slaughter like I'm Jason 
Bust it, why you got it on safety? 
 
 [Rihanna & Bryson Tiller:] 
White girl wasted on brown liquor (on a brown liquor) 
I probably shouldn't be around you (can't be around you) 
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild (wild, wild, wild) 
 
 [Bryson Tiller:] 
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do 
Ayy, girl, that's when I told you 
 
 [Rihanna:] 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
Wild, wild, wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts 
Wild, wild, wild 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
