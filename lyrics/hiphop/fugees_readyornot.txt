[Lauryn Hill:] 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and make you want me 
 
 [Wyclef Jean:] 
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake 
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake 
Jail bars ain't golden gates 
Those who fake, they break 
When they meet their 400 pound mate 
If I could rule the world 
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course 
When giddy-upin' on their horse 
I Kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine 
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased 
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep 
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery that I did last week 
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag 
I wanna play with pellet guns from here to Baghdad 
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit 
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist 
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends 
A born again hooligan only to be king again 
 
 [Lauryn Hill:] 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and make you want me 
 
 [Lauryn Hill:] 
I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest 
No stress 
If you don't smoke sess, lest 
I must confess, my destiny's manifest 
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless 
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess 
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes 
Bless you if you represent the Fu 
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo Voodoo 
I can do what you do, easy, believe me 
Frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees 
So while you're imitating Al Capone 
I'll be Nina Simone 
And defecating on your microphone 
 
 [Lauryn Hill:] 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
 
You can't run away 
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby 
'Cause I got a lot, oh yeah 
And anywhere you go 
My whole crew gonna know 
Oh baby, hey baby 
You can't hide from the block, oh no 
 
 [Pras and Lauryn Hill:] 
Ready or not, refugees takin' over 
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta 
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber 
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers 
Superfly true lies, do or die 
Toss me high only puff la 
With my crew from lakay 
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay 
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay 
Yes, sir 
 
 [Lauryn Hill:] 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and make you want me 
 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and make you want me 
 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and take it slowly 
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide 
Gonna find you and make you want me
