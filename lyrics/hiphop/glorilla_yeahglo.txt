On the gang, gang 
On the gang, gang 
 
Yeah, run up on big Glo, you won't, I bet yo' ass be on the floor 
Big carbon hit like Mayweather, Tula come through and bow a hoe 
Got millions out that rap shit, they hate a bitch but they stole the flow 
Got backend after backend comin', fuck 'em I stole the show 
Don't run up on that bitch, she a headcase, all she do is shoot 
I signed my deal up on a PJ and hopped out a parachute 
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might just stare at you 
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might embarrass you 
 
Yeah Glo! Stomp a lil' pussy ho with some shell toes 
Yeah Glo! Slappin' rap bitches and makin' bail, ho 
Yeah Glo! Two tone Cartier match the nails, ho 
Yeah Glo! No competition, these bitches stale, ho 
Yeah Glo! Cuban on Cuban, my shit is glass, ho 
Yeah Glo! Say they get money, but I can't tell, ho 
Yeah Glo! Keep runnin' circles around these snail hoes 
Yeah Glo! And my shit bumpin' up in the jail, ho 
On the gang 
 
Big Glo, where you been at? Man, everywhere I'm workin' hard 
Maybach and G wagon trucks, got M&M's in my garage 
Quick to crank up on a ho, you bitches better not get me started 
Locked in with the gangstas and players, my folks gon' keep it solid 
Everything I got on new, it look like I got renovated 
Aye 
I'm cocky, bitch, when I was just humble they didn't appreciate it 
Fuck 'em 
Young wealthy and ratchet, I'm the hood bitches' motivation 
On top of the world now, they tried to underestimate me 
Haha 
Get 'em Glo! Them bitches fraudulent, you know you the truth 
Get 'em Glo! Stop overthinkin', these hoes can't fuck with you 
Period 
Get 'em Glo! Standin' on business in these Chanel shoes 
Before I let a ho play with me, I'll go eat some jail food, on gang 
 
Yeah Glo! Stomp a lil' pussy ho with some shell toes 
Yeah Glo! Slappin' rap bitches and makin' bail, ho 
Yeah Glo! Two tone Cartier match the nails, ho 
Yeah Glo! No competition, these bitches stale, ho 
Yeah Glo! Cuban on Cuban, my shit is glass, ho 
Yeah Glo! Say they get money, but I can't tell, ho 
Yeah Glo! Keep runnin' circles around these snail hoes 
Yeah Glo! And my shit bumpin' up in the jail, ho 
 
Yeah, Glo 
Yeah, Glo
