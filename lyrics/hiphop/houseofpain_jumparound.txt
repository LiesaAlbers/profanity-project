Pack it up, pack it in 
Let me begin 
I came to win 
Battle me that's a sin 
I won't ever slack up 
Punk you better back up 
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up 
Get up, stand up, come on! 
Come on, throw your hands up 
If you've got the feeling jump up touch the ceiling 
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk 
Yo, I'll bust em in the eye 
And then I'll take the punk's ho 
Feeling funking 
Amps in the trunk 
And I got more rhymes than there's cops at a "Dunkin Donuts" shop 
Sure enough I got props from the kids on the Hill 
Plus my mom and my pops 
 
I came to get down  [2x] 
So get out your seat and jump around 
Jump around  [3x] 
Jump up, jump up and get down. 
Jump  [18x] 
 
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe 
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho 
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs 
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms 
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned 
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned 
'Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none 
If you come to battle bring a shotgun 
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death 
Trying to step to me you'll take your last breath 
I got the skill, come get your fill 
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill 
 
I came to get down  [2x] 
So get out your seat and jump around 
Jump around  [3x] 
Jump up, jump up and get down. 
Jump  [18x] 
 
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top 
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop 
Or better yet a Terminator 
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger 
Trying to play me out like as if my name was Sega 
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch 
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch 
It up up and around, then buck buck you down 
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead 
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya 
Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya 
I came to get down, I came to get down 
So get out your seat and jump around! 
 
I came to get down  [2x] 
So get out your seat and jump around 
Jump around  [3x] 
Jump up, jump up and get down. 
Jump  [18x] 
 
Jump  [32x] 
 
Yo, this is dedicated 
To Joe "The Biter" Nicolo 
Grab yo Bozack, punk
