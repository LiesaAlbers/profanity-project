I been a (G) 
Throw up the (L) 
Sex in the (A-M) 
Uh-huh 
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah) 
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky) 
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-) 
 
I been a (G)

I can see the whole city from this balcony 
Back in 2019, I was outside freely 
But now they got it out for me 
I don't care what frat that you was in, you came out for me 
Keep dreamin', pineapple juice like it was sweet, sweet, sweet (Seemin') 
I know what they like, so I just keep cheesin' 
Hard drive full of heat-seekin' 
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it 
You don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus 
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons 
 
Uh, I got plaques in the mail, peak season 
Shoutout to my UPS workers makin' sure I receive 'em 
You can do it, too, believe it 
 
I been a (G) 
Throw up the (L) 
Sex in the (A-M) 
Uh-huh 
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah) 
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky) 
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-) 
 
(Are you ready?) 
Yes I am 
 
They say you a superstar now, damn, I guess I am 
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am 
Okay, I'll confess, I am 
"Go ahead and get undressed", "I am" 
"Okay, cool, you on Sunset? ", "I am" 
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay 
This lifestyle don't got many downsides 
'Cept for the lack of time I get 'round my 
Family, makin' sure they never downsize 
I got visions of my mom saying, "Wait, this house mine?" 
Can't lie, I'm on Angus Cloud nine 
I got him on the bandwagon now, 'bout time 
I ain't even got no downtime 
Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine" 
 
I been a (G) 
Throw up the (L) 
Sex in the (A-M) 
Uh-huh 
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah) 
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky) 
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-) 
 
I been a (G) 
Throw up the (L) 
Sex in the (A-M) 
Uh-huh 
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah) 
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky) 
I could put you in (First class)
