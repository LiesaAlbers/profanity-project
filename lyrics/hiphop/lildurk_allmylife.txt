Durkio told me he been on some positive shit (Yeah, yeah) 
Lately I just wanna show up and body some shit (Yeah, yeah) 
Always been a little mathematician 
Lately, it's cash I'm gettin' 
Got me losing count of these bags 
I been moving too fast 
Hard times don't last 
Remember when cops harassed 
Talkin' out my ass 
Boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge 
 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
They been tryna keep me down 
All this time 
All this time 
I never thought I would make it out 
Never thought I'd make it out 
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me 
No, no 
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me 
No 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
(They been tryna keep me down) 
 
I decided I had to finish 
But the media called me a menace 
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image 
You can't blame my past no more 
I come from the trenches 
Some said I'd never be a superstar 
But I know I'm different (No, no, no) 
 
I'm The Voice 
But the system ain't give me a choice 
Know some people that's still unemployed 
I know a felon who tryna get FOID 
Child support your only support 
For a visit I'm going through courts 
Went to jail, they was chaining me up 
And you know that I'm famous as fuck 
See how you gon' joke about stimulus? 
But they really had came in the clutch 
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself 
Stop tryna take drugs I refer to myself 
Tryna better myself 
Tryna better my health 
But 
 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
They been tryna keep me down 
All this time 
All this time 
I never thought I would make it out 
Never thought I'd make it out 
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me 
No, no 
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me 
No 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
They been tryna keep me down 
 
First-generation ghetto nigga 
Cole world, hello niggas 
Made it out the city with my head on straight 
Niggas keep shooting up the lead out 
Young Jordan Peele gotta get out 
And the shit that I spit out 
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO 
And how a nigga put a hit out 
And another one and and another one 
I got like a hundred of 'em 
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they're ahead of me, but I'm really in front of them 
Now some of them fumbling their bags 
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had 
A reminder to humble yourself, this shit could be gone in an instant 
Me, I'm running long distance 
All pistons firing 
I been stuck between maybe retiring and feeling like I'm just not hittin' my prime 
These days seeing rappers be dying 
Way before they're even gettin' their shine 
I never even heard of little buddy 
'Til somebody murdered little buddy 
Now I'm on the phone searchin' little buddy name 
Got to playing his tunes all day in my room 
Thinking, "Damn 
This shit wicked, to get their names buzzin' 
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb" 
And media thirsty for clicks 
I got a new rule 
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive 
You can't post about him after he get hit 
It's simple 
It's the principle 
On any tempo 
I'm invincible 
Don't even rap, I just vent to you 
I rather that than an interview 
Most days 
Fuck 'em all like I'm going through a ho phase 
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage 
I pray all of my dogs stay so paid 
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age 
 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
They been tryna keep me down 
All this time 
All this time 
I never thought I would make it out 
Never thought I'd make it out 
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me 
No, no 
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me 
No 
All my life 
All my life 
They been trying to keep me down 
They been tryna keep me down
