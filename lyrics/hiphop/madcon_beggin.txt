[Tshawe Baqwa:] 
Oh, put your lovin' hand out, baby 
I'm beggin' 
 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, baby 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin' 
 
Ridin' high, when I was king 
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything 
Walked away, wonderin' then 
But easy come and easy go and it would end 
 
 [Yosef Wolde-Mariam:] 
So ah, any time I need ya, let me go 
Any time I feed ya, get me low 
Any time I see ya, let me know 
But I planted that seed, just let me grow 
I'm on my knees while I'm (Beggin') 
'Cause I don't want to lose (You) 
I got my arms so spread 
And I hope that my heart gets fed 
Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' 
 
 [Tshawe Baqwa:] 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, baby 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin' 
 
I need you (Yeah) to understand 
Tried so hard (Hey) to be your man 
The kind of man (Ho) you want in the end 
Only then can I begin to live again 
 
An empty shell I used to be 
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me 
A broken man but I don't know 
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul 
 
 [Yosef Wolde-Mariam:] 
What we doin'? What we chasin'? 
Why the bottom, why da basement? 
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it? 
Why the feel for da need to replace me? 
Ya on a runway track from the good 
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react 
Like the heart in a trash where you should 
You done gave it away, ya' had it 'til you took it back 
But I keep walkin' on, keep rockin' dawns 
Keep walking forward, now the court is yours 
Keep browsin' halls, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home 
Girl, I'm beggin' 
 
 [Tshawe Baqwa:] 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, baby 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin' 
 
I'm fightin' hard (Yeah) 
To hold my own (Hold my own) 
Just can't make it all alone (All alone) 
I'm holdin' on 
Can't fall back (No white body) 
I'm just a con 'bout to fade to black 
 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, baby 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin' 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, baby 
Beggin', beggin' you 
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
