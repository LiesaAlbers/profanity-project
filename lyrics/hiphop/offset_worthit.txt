CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY 
 
You got me, got me workin' (Ooh) 
I hope it's worth it 
You told me you're with him on purpose 
You're doin' whatever to hurt me 
Ooh, it ain't nobody can do it like you, yeah, nah, nah 
Ooh, I need everything cool in the coupe like, yah-yah 
Merry-go-round like a circus 
I wanna buy a new Birkin 
She wanna pop a new Perky 
 
Elliantte on my body, diamonds hittin' (Hittin') 
It's hard to catch a vibe or go outside without you trippin' (Vibe) 
Got niggas tryna line me, I can't ride without my pistol (Line) 
I bought my bitch a Kelly crocodile but not no lizard (Hey, hey, hey) 
Bringin' up the past, the shit I done done before (Past) 
Your feet all in the sand, I flew her to Cabo (Sand) 
Her friend got a lil' Benz, she wanted the Range Rove (Rove) 
I'm watchin' on your 'Gram, you givin' them angles 
I'm payin' for it, you ain't never gotta stress about no landlord (Landlord) 
You ain't never gotta ask me, "What you plan for?" (Plan for) 
Private jet, we puttin' stamps all on your passport 
I got plans for it, leave your man for it 
 
You got me, got me workin' (Ooh) 
I hope it's worth it 
You told me you're with him on purpose 
You're doin' whatever to hurt me 
Ooh, it ain't nobody can do it like you, yeah, nah, nah 
Ooh, I need everything cool in the coupe like, yah-yah 
Merry-go-round like a circus 
I wanna buy a new Birkin 
She wanna pop a new Perky 
 
You know you want me, so why you be playin' for? (Why?) 
The message say delivered, so what you delayin' for? (Hey) 
You think I'm out fuckin' around, I'm in the studio (Yo) 
It's petty shit, tellin' your friends all the info 
Now your heart cold, fuck around buy you a mink coat 
All your friends got on Chanel, only hoes squad goals (Hey) 
I'll go Narco, wack any nigga that seem close 
It's a double R hearse, lil' mama, you seein' ghosts (Ghosts) 
I know you're tight with me, you know the type of nigga I am 
I shoot it spitefully, I don't give a damn what they sayin? 
You better fight for me 
Want me or you don't, tell the truth, don't be lyin' to me 
Need you to be my peace, 'cause these streets get grimey 
See you with another nigga, I'll be damned 
Better not catch him up in traffic, hope my gun don't jam 
You better pick up when you can

You told me you're with him on purpose
