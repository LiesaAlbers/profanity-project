Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl 
Police knock my door, lick up my pal 
Rough me up and I can't do a thing 
Pick up my line when my telephone ring 
Take me to the station, black up my hands 
Trail me down 'cause I'm hanging with the Snowman 
What I'm gonna do, I'm backed and I'm trapped 
Slap me in my face, took all of my gap 
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer 
But Shan won't turn informer
