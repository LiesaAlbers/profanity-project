In case you haven't noticed 
Well, everybody's tired 
And healing from somebody 
Or something we don't see just right 
 
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothing) 
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind) 
And if you find yourself in a dark situation 
Just turn on your light and be like 
 
"Yes, and?" 
Say that shit with your chest, and 
Be your own fuckin' best friend 
Say that shit with your chest 
Keep moving like, "what's next?" 
"Yes, and?" yeah 
 
Now I'm so done with caring 
What you think, no, I won't hide 
Underneath your own projections 
Or change my most authentic life 
 
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothing) 
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind) 
And if you find yourself in a dark situation 
Just turn on your light and be like 
 
"Yes, and?" 
Say that shit with your chest, and 
Be your own fuckin' best friend 
Say that shit with your chest 
Keep moving like, "what's next?" 
"Yes, and?" yeah 
 
My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like 
Protected, sexy, discerning with my time (my time) 
Your energy is yours and mine is mine 
What's mine is mine 
My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise 
Don't comment on my body, do not reply 
Your business is yours and mine is mine 
Why do you care so much whose **** I ride? 
Why? 
 
"Yes, and?" ("yes, and? ") 
Say that shit with your chest and (say that shit with your chest) 
Be your own fuckin' best friend (be your own, be your own) 
Say that shit with your chest (say that shit) 
Keep moving like, "what's next?" (with your chest now, baby) 
"Yes, and?" 
 
"Yes, and?" (hoo) 
Say that shit with your chest and (hoo) 
Be your own fuckin' best friend (be your own) 
Say that shit with your chest 
Keep moving like, "what's next?" 
"Yes, and?" yeah
