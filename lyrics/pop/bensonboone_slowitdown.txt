I'd never met you, but I wanted 
To invite you to the party 
Then you walked in with those green eyes 
Never stolen by nobody 
And they flicker to the future 
For a moment, I could picture 
Then you touch me, and I come back 
And we're talking on the staircase 
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens 
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city 
Lying with me 
And you're scared it's moving quickly 
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces 
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus 
I can feel it 
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're 
 
In your head right now 
While your world is spinning out 
 
So, slow it down 
Take a moment now 
We're too young to drown 
Deep in dirty waters 
Full of hopeless doubt 
Let me pull you out 
Let me hold you now 
Let me slow it down 
 
Ain't it funny how it changes 
How the future rearranges? 
I get nervous, oh I'm anxious 
Maybe loving you is dangerous 
I could lose you like the others 
Only girl that's never left me is my mother 
Oh, I love her 
And I know you probably hate it, but I'm 
 
In my head right now 
 
So, slow it down 
Take a moment now 
We're too young to drown 
Deep in dirty waters 
Full of hopeless doubt 
Let me pull you out 
Let me hold you now 
Let meâ 
 
Slow it 
Slow it down 
When you're on the ground 
And you're crying 
I'm trying (Slow it down) 
To slow it down 
When you're spinning 'round 
In your head 
 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
I'll help you slow it down
