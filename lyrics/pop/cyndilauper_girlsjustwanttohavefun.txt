I come home in the morning light 
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?" 
Oh, mamma, dear, we're not the fortunate ones 
And girlsâthey wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have fun 
 
The phone rings in the middle of the night 
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?" 
Oh, daddy, dear, you know you're still number one 
But girlsâthey wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have 
 
That's all they really want 
Some fun 
When the working day is done 
Oh, girlsâthey wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have fun 
 
Girlsâthey wanna 
Wanna have fun 
Girls wanna have 
 
Some boys take a beautiful girl 
And hide her away from the rest of the world 
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun 
Oh, girlsâthey wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have 
 
That's all they really want 
Some fun 
When the working day is done 
Oh, girlsâthey wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have fun 
 
Girlsâthey wanna 
Wanna have fun 
Girls wanna have 
 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls) 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls just wanna have fun) 
(Girls just wanna have fun) 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls) 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls just wanna have fun) 
Girls 
Girls just wanna have fun 
 
When the working 
When the working day is done 
Oh, when the working day is done 
Oh, girls 
Girls just wanna have fun 
 
Just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls) 
They just wanna, they just wanna 
(Girls just wanna have fun) 
Girls 
Girls just wanna have fun 
 
Just wanna, just wanna 
When the working 
When the working day is done 
Just wanna, just wanna 
(Girls) 
Oh, when the working day is done 
Girls just wanna have fun 
Girls just wanna have fun 
Just wanna, just wanna 
Just wanna
