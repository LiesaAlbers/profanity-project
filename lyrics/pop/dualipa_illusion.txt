I been known to miss a red flag 
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal 
In the end, those things just don't last 
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off 
 
I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (Ah-ah) 
Tryin' make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (Ah-ah) 
I already know your type, think you can play your cards right (Ah-ah) 
Don't you know I could do this dance all night? 
 
Ooh, what you doin'? 
Don't know who you think that you're confusing 
I be like, "Ooh, it's amusing" 
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion 
 
Dance all night, dance all night 
Dance all night, dance all night 
I be like, "Ooh" 
Dance all night, dance all night 
Dance all night, dance, dance 
 
Was a time when that shit might have worked 
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn 
Now I'm grown, I know what I deserve 
I still like dancing with the lessons I already learned 
 
I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (Ah-ah) 
Tryin' make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (Ah-ah) 
I already know your type, think you can play your cards right (Ah-ah) 
Don't you know I could do this dance all night? 
 
Ooh, what you doin'? 
Don't know who you think that you're confusing 
I be like, "Ooh, it's amusing" 
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion 
 
Dance all night, dance all night 
Dance all night, dance all night 
I be like, "Ooh" 
Dance all night, dance all night 
Dance all night, dance, dance 
 
Illusion, I really like the way you're moving 
Yeah, I just wanna dance with the illusion 
Yeah, I just wanna dance with 
Yeah, I just wanna dance with 
I could dance all night 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
 
Ooh, what you doin'? 
Don't know who you think that you're confusing 
I be like, "Ooh, it's amusing" 
You think I'm gonna fall for an illuâ 
Ooh-ooh, what you doin'? 
Don't know who you think that you're confusing 
I be like, "Ooh, it's amusing" 
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
