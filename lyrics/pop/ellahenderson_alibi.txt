Gotta say I'm sorry and that liquor made me 
Your momma never tell you how to treat a lady? 
By this time tomorrow you gon' really hate me 
Bet you wish you never play-ayed me 
You took her in our bed, you got no respect 
Why did you expect? Now I burned this house down 
To the left, I'm on to the next 
I'ma get my sweet revenge 
 
Tell me how you lie so easily? 
You've been messin' with her, don't mess with me, yeah 
Tell me how you lie so easily? 
You've been messin' with her, don't mess with me
