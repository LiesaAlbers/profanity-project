I just wanna 
I just feel like, ooh 
Every time I see ya 
I just, ooh, hey 
 
I feel like startin' something 
You got my engine runnin' 
You got the keys to turn me on and on 
You got me acceleratin' 
I want to celebrate it 
Can't nothing take me out my zone 
It's on 
 
When it feels right 
Nothing else matters 
Is this real life? 
Too good to be true 
Take me all night 
I can feel the passion in your eyes 
I'm still in love with you 
 
You know I can't get enough 
I love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
You love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
Give me all that shit 
Can't get enough 
You know I can't get enough 
I love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
You love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
Give me all that shit 
Can't get enough of you 
I'm still in love 
With you, boy 
 
I just wanna 
I just feel like 
Every time I see ya, it's like 
Oh, hey 
 
Give me that touchin', teasin' 
So good I can't believe it 
Don't wanna share with no one else 
You're always the one I needed 
Don't gotta keep a secret 
But I let you keep me to yourself 
 
'Cause, bae, it feels like 
Nothing else matters 
Is this real life? 
Too good to be true 
Take me all night 
I can feel the passion 
In your eyes 
I'm still in love with you 
 
You know I can't get enough 
I love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
You love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
Give me all that shit 
Can't get enough 
You know I can't get enough 
I love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
You love that shit 
You know I can't get enough 
Give me all that shit 
Can't get enough of you 
I'm still in love 
With you, boy 
I'm still in love 
With you, boy (I can't get enough of you) 
 
It's the way you love me, the way you touch me 
It's the way you look at me 
Can't get enough 
Of you, boy
