All night long 
 
I haven't seen you for a while boy 
Do you still think about the times where we were close 
You really take me out of the darkness 
The light is hitting me and I feel miracles 
 
Ohhh I wanna feel alive 
When you're around 
 
Hold me baby 
Drive me crazy 
Touch me 
All night long 
Make me love you 
Kiss and hug you 
Touch me 
All night long 
 
All night long 
All night long 
 
Oh you're living in my mind boy 
I'm getting tired of all the ways I keep saying your name 
You got me driving through a red light 
If I crash into your arms then you're to blame 
 
Ohhh I wanna feel alive 
When you're around 
 
Hold me baby 
Drive me crazy 
Touch me 
All night long 
Make me love you 
Kiss and hug you 
Touch me 
All night long 
 
Ooo you know how to let me yeah 
When we make love all night 
Hmm I need you so bad baby 
Ohh 
 
This is where you belong 
Don't make me wait too long 
 
Hold me baby 
Drive me crazy 
Touch me 
All night long 
Make me love you 
Kiss and hug you 
Touch me 
All night long 
 
Hold me baby 
Drive me crazy 
Touch me 
All night long 
Make me love you 
Kiss and hug you 
Touch me 
All night long 
 
All night long 
All night long
