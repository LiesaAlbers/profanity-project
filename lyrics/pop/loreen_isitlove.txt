You'll find me in the echo of the dark 
Working on the riddle of your heart 
Lost you in a maze, now let me out 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
 
Without a warning 
Without a sign 
Will you call me 
Or will you hide? 
There's a shadow 
In my mind 
How do I know it? 
Is it love? 
 
Tell me where in your heart am I now? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
Tell me what do you feel in the night? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
Is it love, is it love? 
Tell me how do you sleep when I'm not by your side? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
 
You'll find me in the middle of the sea 
Drowning in the words that we don't speak 
Bring me out, don't leave me in the deep 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
 
Without a warning 
Without a sign 
Will you call me 
Or will you hide? 
There's a shadow 
Oh, in my mind 
How do I know it? 
Is it love? 
 
Tell me where in your heart am I now? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
Tell me what do you feel in the night? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love? 
Is it love, is it love? 
Tell me how do you sleep when I'm not by your side? 
Is it love, is it love, is it love?
