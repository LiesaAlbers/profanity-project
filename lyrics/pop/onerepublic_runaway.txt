Runaway 
Right now let's just runaway 
All that talk is killing me 
One last shot, hold onto me 
 
There's something I got to say to ya 
There's somewhere we gotta go 
And now we're sinking in the sand, chasin' what we can 
Baby, it's not enough 
It's like we're stuck in the mezzanine 
With twenty floors left to go (oh yeah) 
And now we're driving in the rain, trying to switch the lane 
But you already know 
 
So don't waste this time, yeah I don't move slow 
But one good shot and I'll let you know 
It's all I want, yeah 
Can we just let go and 
 
Runaway 
Right now let's just runaway 
All that talk is killing me 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh) 
Babe, I think we should runaway 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Blue sky's only miles away 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh) 
 
There's something I got to say to you 
I'm on that new energy (oh yeah) 
Not on that easy as it goes, wait for miracles 
No, what will be will be 
 
No, so don't waste this time, yeah I don't move slow 
But one good shot and I'll let you know 
It's all I want, yeah 
Can we just let go and 
 
Runaway 
Right now let's just runaway 
All that talk is killing me 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh) 
Babe, I think we should runaway 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Blue sky's only miles away 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh) 
 
(Oh yeah) 
(Runaway) 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh) 
 
Runaway 
Right now let's just runaway 
All that talk is killing me 
One last shot, hold onto me (oh)
