Girl 
 
You my lil' boo thang 
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know 
You a lil' too tame 
I'll be shooting that shot like 2K, girl, I know 
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next 
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh, I know 
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next

Put a little gold in the teeth 
And the fit good, so I took the doors off the Jeep, okay 
I see a brother holding your seat, no beef 
But I'm tryna get to know you at least 
Don't take my talking to you wrong 
I can keep it chill like a Sauvignon Blanc 
I'ma keep it real when your man long gone 
If you looking for a friend then you got the wrong song (hey, hey) 
 
Baby girl, what's good? What's wit' ya? 
If you booked tonight, that's fiction 
I'm outside, no pictures 
You want me, go figure 
To the back, to the front 
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (hey) 
To the back (to the back) 
To the front (to the front) 
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (one)

So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know

I'm singing, and it's like 
Oh-whoa, you got the best of my love 
Oh-whoa, you got the best of my-, my- 
Oh-whoa (what you got?) You got the best of my love 
Oh-whoa (ha), and in that dress I'm like (whoa)
