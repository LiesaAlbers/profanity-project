Trustfall, baby 
It's a trustfall, baby 
 
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt 
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse, oh my 
We see through bloodshot eyes 
 
Picture a place somewhere else far away 
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us 
And would that be enough? 
 
Are we running out of time? 
Are we hiding from the light? 
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight? 
 
Close your eyes and leave it all behind 
Go where love is on our side 
It's a trustfall, baby 
It's a trustfall, baby 
 
You and I and everyone alive 
We can run into the fire 
It's a trustfall, baby 
Yeah it's a trustfall, baby 
 
Jump with me, come with me, burn like the sun 
We'll talk then we'll cry then we'll laugh 'til we're done, oh my 
It's like we're out our minds 
 
We've been running for our lives 
We've been hiding from the light 
We've been far too scared to fight for what we want tonight 
 
Close your eyes and leave it all behind 
Go where love is on our side 
It's a trustfall, baby 
It's a trustfall, baby 
 
You and I and everyone alive 
We can run into the fire 
It's a trustfall, baby 
Yeah, it's a trustfall, baby 
 
What if we just fall? 
I'm not going without you 
And you're not going alone 
I fell so far till I found you 
But you know what you know when you know 
So I'm not going without you 
And you're not going alone 
'Cause you know when you know 
 
Close your eyes and leave it all behind 
Go where love is on our side 
It's a trustfall, baby 
It's a trustfall, baby 
 
What if we just fall? 
What if we just fall? 
What if we just fall? 
What if we just fall? 
 
What if we just fall? 
What if we just fall? 
What if we just-
