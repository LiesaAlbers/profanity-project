(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
Oh, not another take 
 
Oh, it's like that 
I'm your dream come true 
when it's on a platter for you 
Then you pull back 
When I try to make plans 
more than two hours in advance mm 
 
I slam the door 
I hit "Ignore" 
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more." 
I got you blocked after this an after thought 
I finally cut you off 
 
I feel so much lighter, like a feather with you off my mind, ah 
Floating through the memories, like whatever, you're a waste of time, ah 
Your signals are mixed 
You act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic" 
I feel so much lighter, like a feather with you out my life 
With you out my life 
 
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah 
 
It feels so good 
Not caring where you are tonight 
And it feels so good 
Not pretending to like the wine you like 
 
I slam the door (slam the door) 
I hit "Ignore" (Hit "Ignore") 
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more." 
I got you blocked 
Excited to never talk 
I, I'm so sorry for your loss 
 
I feel so much lighter, like a feather with you off my mind, ah 
Floating through the memories, like whatever, you're a waste of time, ah 
Your signals are mixed 
You act like a bitch (A bitch) 
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic" 
I feel so much lighter, like a feather with you out my life 
With you out my life 
 
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
Ah, mm 
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather 
 
You want me? I'm done 
You miss me? No duh 
Where I'm at, I'm up 
Where I'm at 
 
You want me? I'm done (I'm done) 
You miss me? No duh (No duh) 
Where I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) 
Where I'm at 
 
You want me? I'm done. You miss me? No duh 
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Where I'm at, I'm up, where I'm at 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather 
 
You want me? I'm done. You miss me? No duh 
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Where I'm at, I'm up, where I'm at 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
