Should I do it on the phone? 
Should I leave a little note in the pocket of his coat? 
Yeah 
Maybe I'll just disappear 
I don't wanna see a tear 
And the weekend's almost here 
 
I'm picking out this dress 
Trying on these shoes 
'Cause I'll be single soon 
I'll be single soon 
I know he'll be a mess 
When I break the news 
But I'll be single soon 
I'll be single soon 
 
I'ma date who I wanna 
Stay out late if I wanna 
I'ma do what I wanna do 
I'm picking out this dress 
Trying on these shoes 
'Cause I'll be single soon 
I'll be single soon 
 
I know I'm a little high maintenance 
But I'm worth a try 
Might not give a reason why 
Oh well 
We both had a lot of fun 
Time to find another one 
Blame it all on feeling young
