Something's got a hold of me lately 
No, I don't know myself anymore 
Feels like the walls are all closing in 
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa 
 
Outta my mind, how many times 
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone? 
Yeah it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep 
From tearing the skin off my bones 
 
Don't you know 
I lose control 
When you're not next to me? 
I'm falling apart right in front of you 
Can't you see 
I lose control 
When you're not next to me? 
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby 
You make a mess of me 
 
Problematic, problem is 
I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit 
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you 
Yeah I know, I could do it on my own, but I want 
That real full moon black magic and it takes two 
Problematic, problem is 
When I'm with you I'm an addict 
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth 
Can't see the forest through the trees 
Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh 
 
I lose control 
When you're not next to me 
I'm falling apart right in front of you 
Can't you see 
I lose control 
When you're not next to me? 
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby 
You make a mess of me, yeah 
 
I lose control 
When you're not here with me 
I'm falling apart right in front of you 
Can't you see 
I lose control 
When you're not here with me? 
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby 
You make a mess of me
